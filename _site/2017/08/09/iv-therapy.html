<p>For patients looking to treat a variety of common conditions without relying on pharmaceutical treatments that may cause damaging side effects, intravenous (IV) nutrient therapy may be the answer. IV therapy provides a powerful surge of nutrients not achievable with oral vitamins – in some cases providing 100 times more nutrients – and can be used to treat a wide variety of conditions, from hangovers to stress. Best of all, because your body needs nutrients to survive, there are no harmful side effects.</p>

<p>Intravenous nutrient therapy works by delivering nutrients directly into the bloodstream instead of sending them through the GI tract to be dispersed. Oral vitamins can often be difficult to digest, making them essentially useless to the body. But IV therapy floods the cells with nutrients, immediately increasing their functionality.</p>

<p>The nutrients used for IV therapy are specifically selected to work together harmoniously to help heal the body and provide greater energy. Here are just a few conditions that can be treated with IV therapy.</p>

<p>Hangover: Overdo it a bit while celebrating last night? Don’t worry, there’s an IV therapy treatment for that. IV therapy treats hangovers by infusing the body with detoxifying vitamins and minerals that help to correct the root causes of hangovers, including immune system changes, dehydration and loss of electrolytes.</p>

<p>Stress: We all have stress. In fact, a certain degree of stress is normal. But our bodies were not meant to be kept under constant stress – and doing so can take its toll. If excessive stress has left you feeling tired, irritable and generally unwell, IV therapy can help. Bios Functional Medicine’s stress recovery and energy treatment provides a unique blend of nutrients that will boost the immune system, fight fatigue, improve brain function and boost the body’s natural healing process.</p>

<p>Wound Healing: Healing from an injury or surgical procedure can be a long and painful process. Unfortunately, many people think there is no way to speed the process up, but believe it or not, IV therapy can help. Bios Functional Medicine canprovide a combination of vitamins, minerals and antioxidants via IV therapy that have been shown to shorten healing time and reduce pain and inflammation. One study even found it to reduce post-op infections by 85 percent.</p>

<p>Immune Boost: Do you feel like you’re always getting sick? Whether you work with children or just have a weak immune system due to age or illness, being chronically sick can take a devastating toll on your life. From lost work and wages to secondary infections like bronchitis or pneumonia, lengthy illnesses are more than just a nuisance. After all, if your immune system is stressed it can’t work to fight more serious illnesses that may try to attack the body.</p>

<p>Bios Functional Medicine can help rebuild your immune system with IV therapy by providing a boost of vitamins and nutrients that work together to help restore depleted reserves and fight off current illnesses.</p>

<p>Athletic Performance: If you’re an athlete but not feeling like you’re at the top of your game, IV therapy may even the score by providing a natural boost of energy that not only increases your physical performance, but also assists in reducing recovery time, encourages muscle growth and helps to replace nutrients lost by strenuous activity.</p>

<p>If you’re interested in treating any of these conditions, or if you’d like to see if IV therapy may be able to help with another condition, please give Dr. Lekkos a call at 310-955-1885.</p>
