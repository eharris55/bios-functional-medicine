    Bios Functional Medicine takes an "inside-out" approach to your health. Instead of simply bandaging symptoms, we look at you, as whole person, and address true underlying causes. Our goal is to not only help you feel better now, but to help you live a vital and robust life for as long as you can. We also offer groundbreaking regenerative services using adult stem cells to activate the body's built-in mechanism of self-repair and restore function to once declining health.

      "He is excited by new science and up to date on cutting edge technology and testing. I have worked with a number of functional medicine and anti-aging specialists and he is by far the best. He doesn’t push you, he counsels you and helps you make the decisions that work best for you. He is who I refer all my clients to and also the doctor I trust with my own health."
