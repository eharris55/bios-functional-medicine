    Harness the Power of Stem Cells
  </h2>
</div>
<div class="col-8_sm-12 padded padding-top-none">
  <p>
    Stem cells are non-specific cells that have the ability to replenish and repair damaged tissue. While most conventional treatment strategies for degenerative and inflammatory conditions involve invasive surgeries and drugs riddled with side-effects that serve to merely control symptoms, stem cell therapy offers a way of achieving longer-term tissue healing and repair. By using a cutting-edge technique to harvest autologous stem cells (from one's own body) and inserting the cells into the afflicted area, this healing modality can be used to regenerate damaged tissue, as the stem cells differentiate into whatever type of tissue is lacking. Itâ€™s a way of tapping into the body's natural repair system.
