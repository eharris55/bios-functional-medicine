      “Dr. Lekkos has been a life-saver for me.”
    </h5>
    <p class="test-p">
      “I’ve been to so many doctors and specialists over the years who have been extremely unhelpful. I came to Dr. Lekkos with chronic fatigue, terrible IBS, debilitating brain fog, insomnia, panic attacks, constant anxiety, and exhaustion after workouts. After conducting several tests and going through his diet and supplement protocol I’m now sleeping well, anxiety is way down, my brain fog is almost completely gone and my energy and IBS are beginning to improve. Dr. Lekkos really took the time to get to know me as a person and understands there are so many factors that affect health beyond standard lab tests. He also helped me find other practitioners out of his area of expertise who have helped immensely. My family and friends have all had great experiences with Dr. Lekkos. I can’t recommend him enough.”

      “Dr. Lekkos has been able to help me with ailments that no other doctors or professionals were able to help me with.”
    </h5>
    <p class="test-p">
      “I began seeing Dr. Lekkos approximately one year ago. Dr. Lekkos has been able to help me with ailments that no other doctors or professionals were able to help me with, including horomonal and sinus issues. Dr. Lekkos makes himself available by email and is easy to talk to. He explains things in layman terms so that laymen like myself can understand what he is talking about.
      Additionally, I have always been a very healthy eater and I exercise regularly; however, there are supplement deficiencies I did not know I had. When Dr. Lekkos uncovered them and suggested certain supplements, my energy increased and my memory and thought processes seem stronger and clearer. I have highly recommended Dr. Lekkos to my friends and family.”

        “A revolutionary approach to helping me heal.”
      </h5>
      <p class="test-p">
        “This year I was going to get rid of toxins in my body by following a rigid diet and exercise program that I meticulously researched for months. My doctor seemed to have covered all of my ailments with prescribed medicines for high cholesterol, diabetes, constipation, ADD, weight gain, sleep, and three anti-depressants. It was during the 10th month of the year that I realized something wasn’t right. I was so puffy, my clothes didn’t fit, I couldn’t retain a thought for more that 10 minutes at a time, and my bones and joints hurt so badly that I couldn’t exercise or walk the beach. I had heard of Dr. Lekkos for months, but was hesitant to go to yet another doctor. I thought my previous doctor had done the tests needed to heal me, but it was a lost cause! The doctor I trusted so much had done all he could to help me, but it just made me worse. It was through a group of physician assistants that told me about Dr. Lekkos and his new approach to helping your body stay balanced, while working together as a team. My husband was ready to kill me because I was going to yet another doctor, but I had to try. Dr. Lekkos has taken a revolutionary approach to helping me heal and I can honestly say, due to his guidance, and knowing the exact malfunctions of my body chemistry, I am feeling better and more energized daily. It’s not easy, because I truly was harming myself with all the prescription medicines I had taken for the last year. I’ve gone off of them slowly while adding the functional medicine approach Dr. Lekkos has prescribed. The difference is that now, my body is functioning as it should be and my metabolism is beginning to level itself out. Without the help of Dr. Lekkos and the education he has given me along the way- I would have never felt this free or balanced. I cannot wait until this time next year- I’ll be feeling the way I should be! Thank you!"

      “We couldn't be more grateful.”
    </h5>
    <p class="test-p">
      “I started seeing Dr. Lekkos at the gentle urging of my nutritionist and health coach. I spent the majority of 2014 at the fertility doctor trying to solve things that only left more questions, more weight gain, and more frustration. A deeply positive person by nature, I had resigned myself to the fact that my body had shifted and I had lost control, and that I needed to accept this new form and wrap my head around moving forward from there. At the core, I didn’t want to miss another summer of enjoying the beach and the ocean, sitting it out from shame and frustration. I trust my nutritionist implicitly, so when she suggested an appointment with Dr. Lekkos, I quickly agreed but also was resolute that this was the last consultation I’d entertain on this journey. For the first time in a long time, I didn’t feel any shame as I unravelled what was going on, how I felt, and ultimately how I hoped to feel to Dr. Lekkos. He quickly got to work, deeply analyzing the entire picture of my health and intervening in all areas that needed improvement with supplements, advice, and direction. I’ve seen huge shifts in so many areas in a few short months, from weight, to energy, to a returning cycle, to my skin … all of it. The difference is deeply noticeable and I’m constantly asked what I’m doing and who I’m seeing and whole heartedly point my dear friends and family into Dr. Lekko’s care. My gratitude is endless, and my husband and I find renewed energy in the shifts that are happening, and we couldn’t be more grateful.”

      “A plethora of knowledge that goes beyond medical school.”
    </h5>
    <p class="test-p">
      "For the last two years I started developing gradual symptoms of lethargy, depression, anxiety, and a huge disinterest in life. As a Physician I did not recognize what was happening to my mind and body. I shrugged it off as a temporary low in my life but my symptoms worsened each day and month. I was so low that I would sleep 14 hours a day and could barely get out of bed to go to the grocery store or even work.
      After two Doctors and treatments close to malpractice, I found Dr Lekkos!
      Dr Lekkos was truly my savior and genuinely had my health and well being his primary goal. He is an amazing Doctor with a plethora of knowledge that goes beyond medical school. He is compassionate, listens, and communicative. As an MD, it was initially difficult being on the other side of the fence as a patient. After a few clinic visits and lab tests, he formulated my diagnoses and started me immediately on a recovery program with weekly calls to see how I was progressing. After sometime my symptoms began to dissipate and my energy levels and love for life has returned. I know that I would still be suffering daily if I did not find Dr Lekkos. He has saved me and I continue to heal daily! Thank you Dr Lekkos”
